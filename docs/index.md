Welcome to the comprehensive guide for **Heaps.io** - a mature, cross-platform graphics engine designed for high-performance games.

## What is Heaps?

Heaps is a game engine built with [Haxe](https://haxe.org) that leverages modern GPU capabilities for both 2D and 3D games. It's the technology behind successful indie games like Dead Cells, Northgard, and Evoland.

## Why Choose Heaps?

- **Performance First**: GPU-accelerated rendering with automatic batching
- **Cross-Platform**: Deploy to PC, mobile, consoles, and web from a single codebase
- **Modern Architecture**: Component-based entities, shader system, and resource pipeline
- **Battle-Tested**: Used in commercial games with millions of players
- **Open Source**: MIT licensed with active community

## Quick Start

```haxe
class Main extends hxd.App {
    override function init() {
        var text = new h2d.Text(hxd.res.DefaultFont.get(), s2d);
        text.text = "Hello Heaps!";
        text.center();
    }
    
    static function main() {
        new Main();
    }
}
```
